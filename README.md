Adrenaline is a Car Game
Adrenaline is a classic car game that is built on HTML canvas.
CSS was used for the styling of the game.
JavaScript was used for implementing the objects, their movements, and animations.
The carâ€™s movements can be controlled with the help of the arrow keys and further outside movements have been restricted using brute force.
